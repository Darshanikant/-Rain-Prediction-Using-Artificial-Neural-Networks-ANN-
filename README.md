# Rain Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) üåßÔ∏è

## Overview  
- This project leverages Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether it will rain the next day based on historical weather data. Using over 10 years of daily observations from various locations in Australia, the model was trained to make accurate predictions with a focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization.

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handled missing values for both categorical and numerical data using mode and median strategies.  
  - Encoded cyclic features for date columns using sine and cosine transformations.  
  - Removed outliers to ensure cleaner data for training.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Heatmaps to display correlations between attributes.  
  - Line plots and scatter plots for trends in rainfall and wind speeds.

- **Model Development:**  
  - Multi-layer ANN with Dropout and Batch Normalization for better generalization.  
  - Optimized using the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.00009.  
  - Achieved **85% training accuracy** and effective validation results.
